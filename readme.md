# CSE203: Data Structure, Spring 2018

### Project Topics
- Binary Tree
- Graph Tree
- Infix to Postfix
- Polygon
- Heapify
- Huffman Encoding/Decoding
- Recursive functions

### Description
Data representation and storage in elementary data structures like arrays and linked lists (both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists). Abstract Data Types (ADT): Stack, Queue, Priority Queue. Comparative analysis of different implementations of ADTs (Array based and linked list based).  Binary Search Tree (including red/black trees), Heap, Efficient  Priority  Queue (Heap based).  Complexity analysis of dictionary operations (insertion/deletion/search) on ADTs. Use of data structures in the design and implementation of smart searching and sorting algorithms (Binary search, Heap sort). Graphs (Connectivity graph, Directed and Undirected graph).

### Prerequisites
- CSC 101+ Lab : Introduction to Computer Programming
- CSC 201 : Discrete Mathematics

### Expected Outcome(s)
- Navigate, organize, compile C++ projects of moderate complexity (many objects and dependencies)
- Decompose a problem into its supporting data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.
- Diagnose appropriate approaches or algorithms to solve problems involving graph search, tree traversal, optimization, data organization, etc., together with appropriate data structures.
- Implement classic and adapted data structures and applications.
- Analyze the efficiency of implementation choices.
